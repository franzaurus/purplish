# Purplish
A WordPress theme with a three-layer parallax hero section. Here I take inspiration from the works of Studio VØR and WebDev For You. I built this theme on top of the WordPress' Twenty Twenty-Four theme, that means this is a customizing work. I made a separate theme out of the customization for a documentation purpose.
