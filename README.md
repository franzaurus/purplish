# Purplish
A WordPress theme with a three-layer parallax hero section. Here I take inspiration from the works of Studio VØR and WebDev For You, which designed and built the website in Webflow respectively. This theme is based on Twenty Twenty-Four theme. I don't own any images that are included in this work. All the images are the property of their respective owner.
